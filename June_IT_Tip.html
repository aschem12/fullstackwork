  <body>Google Verification Codes</body>
  <hr />
  <p>Google Backup Verification codes can be used if you donâ€™t have your phone or otherwise can't get codes via text, voice call, or Google Authenticator, you can use backup codes to sign in.  If you don't have your security key, you can also use these codes to sign in.  Keep in mind that each Backup Verification code is only good for one time used only.  You can generate a new set of 10 Backup Verification codes whenever you want.  After creating a new set, the old set automatically becomes inactive.
